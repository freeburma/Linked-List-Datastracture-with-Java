# Linked-List-Datastracture-with-Java
Singly Linked List (Data Stracture) in Java

This program use linked list datastructure. 
This program will encode and decode the text from the text file. You need to test this program form command line arguments. This is not a hight compact coding program however, you can learn how to encode and decode with Java Datastracture. The best thing is using data structure. 
My Program will need to enter 2 times for file name. I would like you to give the first time and second time for differnet 
file name to avoid overriding. 


Eg : 
1 - Enter to output to text file name for Encodeing : encode
2 - Enter to output to text file name for Decodeing : decode

Got only 94% for marking.
