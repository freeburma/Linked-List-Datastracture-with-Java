Burma is currently called Myanmar. You should call "Burma" to support the democratic movement. 
Burma has ruled by military dictatorship. They changed the name to Myanmar witout consultation with public. 
I reconmend to call Burma to support Democracy movement. I'll let you know when you should call Myanamr when it would be approved by the public. 

Thank for calling Burma.
